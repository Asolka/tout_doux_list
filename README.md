# Tout Doux List 📝

My second project: a web **to-do list app** called “Tout Doux List” where I focused on **JavaScript** interactivity over HTML/CSS.  
I learned to dynamically create HTML elements, interact with the DOM, and store data using **localStorage**.

## ✨ Features
- Add new tasks  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Delete tasks  
- Tasks persist via `localStorage` so they stay after page reload  
- Smooth interaction with the UI

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Asolka/tout_doux_list.git
Open index.html in your browser

## 🎯 Goals
This project helped me:
- Practice manipulating the DOM dynamically with JavaScript
- Use localStorage to store user data between sessions
- Improve my JavaScript logic and event handling
- Build a real, usable web app from scratch
